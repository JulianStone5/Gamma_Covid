# Gamma_Covid

Welcome to our project on COVID19. Here we explore the relationship between reported COVID19 cases in countries around the world and each country's GDP per capita. We were interested to find if there GDP could be a factor in the number of cases a nation might have. To see our report, navigate to our Covid16_Report.md file.
