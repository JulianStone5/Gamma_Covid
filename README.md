# Gamma_Covid

### Planning/Check-in
#### Question
- What relationships are there bewtween GDP and cases rate? Do these change when moving from a county-level to a country-level population?
- If there is a relationship, would factors could be the causes?

#### What data will be used
- Use the NYT data that is split via county
- Obtain census data that contains gdp or medan household income? (unsure if this available)
- Dont know how trustworthy but https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus, has some data for countries around the world (Link: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data)

#### Potential Challenges
- Finding the data (for state/country)!
- New York city is not split by county in the NYT dataset but liekly will be in the census data
- Colin seems like he is gone so we may be a man down

#### Scoping/ Complexity
- Low Complexity -- Good quality writeup(portfolio ready) but not ridiculous amounts of time spent on code
- We are all swamped with other classes and need to keep our heads above water

#### Anticpatory results(figures and tables)
- We anticipate figures showing the highest and lowest covid death and case rates and their GDP  or household income
- We liekly would do the same thing and lok at the counties with the highest and lowest GDP
- A plot with gdp sorted along the x axis and case and death shown in y (maybe with cases per 100k)
